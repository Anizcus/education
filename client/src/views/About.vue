      Hello, this is simple web application to create a lesson / questions for categorized topics as math, english and etc. 
    </p>
    <p>
      I took VueJS to try it out with .NET Core and Entity Framework. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The purpose of this is to work on Bachelor degree final work, but for me it is also to learn new things (technologies and etc.)
