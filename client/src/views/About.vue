      Hello, this is simple web application to create a lesson / questions for categorized topics as math, english and etc. 
      I took VueJS to try it out with .NET Core and Entity Framework. 
      The purpose of this is to work on Bachelor degree final work, but for me it is also to learn new things (technologies and etc.)
